        Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

  The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

  You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.

 

        Example 1:

        Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
        Output: [24,12,8,6]
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: List[int]
        hint: left array will have the left muliply of (i-1) elements, right will also have same,if we multiply both we will get the multiply matrix.
        to save the space, output will have the right side of multiply and then loop over left side and get the left side of multiple and multiply with right output element.

        output=[1]
